The tariffs are intended to yield opportunities while also posing risks to global supply chains and inflation. The author emphasizes the need to clarify the primary goal of the tariffs and strategize their implementation carefully to mitigate risks of recession while aiming to create jobs. March 4, 2025. https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebanker/2025/03/04/20-thoughts-on-tariffs-by-a-supply-chain-practitioner/\n\nThis article outlines the views of prominent economists on President Trump’s tariff plans, which aim to impose tariffs of 25% on goods from Canada and Mexico, and 10% on Chinese products. Economists warn that these tariffs could raise consumer prices and negatively affect economic growth, employment, and international relations. The article stresses the broader repercussions, particularly the perception of the U.S. as a reliable trading partner and the implications for domestic job markets and inflation. February 3, 2025. https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-trade-economy-krugman-summers-hanke-reich-2025-2\n\nJ.P. Morgan Global Research provides an analysis of the growing list of U.S. tariffs and their implications for the economy. It reports that the average effective tariff rate has increased significantly, leading to concerns about rising consumer prices and reduced economic growth. The analysis also underscores that retaliatory measures from trading partners have not materialized as expected, which could help alleviate some economic pressures. August 11, 2025. https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/current-events/us-tariffs\n\nThe article highlights how newly imposed tariffs by the Trump administration may result in increased prices for consumers and ongoing uncertainty for businesses. Experts note that many products' prices are expected to rise due to the elevated tariffs, which could result in higher living costs for Americans. Additionally, the article discusses the potential for reduced consumer choices and supply chain challenges as businesses adapt to the new tariff landscape. August 2, 2025. https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-2025-prices/\n\nThe Q&A article with a Brown University economics professor articulates the potential negative impacts of the proposed tariffs on the U.S. economy. It emphasizes that tariffs act as taxes on imported goods, ultimately leading to higher prices for consumers and potential declines in consumption and investment, contributing to inflation and recession risks. The professor notes the highly integrated trade relationship between the U.S. and its major trading partners and warns that significant tariffs could disrupt economic stability.
