The head plays a crucial role in various sensory functions including sight, hearing, smell, and taste. This anatomical structure can vary significantly among species, as some simpler organisms may lack a head altogether.

Trump has also labeled the interest in the case as a \"hoax,\" suggesting that the focus should shift away from it. The frustration stems from the Justice Department's recent memo which claimed there was no significant new evidence regarding Epstein, who died in custody in 2019. July 17, 2025, CBS News, https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-would-not-recommend-special-prosecutor-epstein-case-white-house-says/.\n\nIn a discussion surrounding accountability, President Trump reportedly expressed support for appointing a special prosecutor to investigate the Epstein case and other actions tied to government officials, as revealed by journalist John Solomon. This conversation occurred during a preview of Solomon's interview with Trump on a podcast hosted by Steve Bannon. Trump\u2019s allies have been vocal about the need for greater transparency concerning the Epstein investigation, especially following a memo from the DOJ indicating no incriminating evidence had been found. Solomon noted that Trump is interested in restoring trust and accountability while addressing concerns related to Epstein. July 16, 2025, Newsweek, https://www.newsweek.com/trump-epstein-case-special-prosecutor-solomon-interview-bannon-2099887.\n\nThe White House once again reaffirmed that Trump will not push for a special counsel to review the Epstein case, according to press secretary Karoline Leavitt. This statement was made amidst persistent calls from some of Trump's staunchest supporters who are advocating for further investigation into the handling of Epstein's case and related files. Leavitt stated that Trump believes the Justice Department has conducted a thorough review but emphasized that any new credible evidence must be handled by the attorney general. The administration has faced backlash over its transparency regarding Epstein, leading Trump to urge supporters to let go of conspiracy theories surrounding the case.
